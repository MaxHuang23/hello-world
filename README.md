My name is Max.

Why did you take this course and what are you hoping to get out of it?
I took this course because I want to pursue this field in university and because I enjoy coding. I hope to further develop my knowledge in python and make more games.

What games and/or applications do you think are designed very well or have interesting features you would like to learn how to implement in your own games/applications? List the apps and features.
Games (mostly for movement mechanics):
- Celeste
- Hollowknight

Applications (visual appeal):
- Webpages
- Spotify

Social media (direct messages and posting online)"
- Instagram
- Discord
